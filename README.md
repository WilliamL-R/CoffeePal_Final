# CoffeePal_Final

CoffeePal is team Buttercups Android application which was created by second year University of Huddersfield students for the Team Project module and was developed using an Agile Scrum Method. 

This application is only the user side of the application and allows us to connect to make an order which will go towards the staff side of the application.

NOTE: This version is the portfolio piece to show the code behind the functionality of the app, this version will not run without access to the google-services.json file which I have kept private as it has private information.
